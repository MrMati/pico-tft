## TFT_eSPI without Arduino

This is a successful attempt to use TFT_eSPI on RaspberryPi Pico (or any RP2040) without using Arduino as a framework.
Minimum amount of code has been copied from Arduino to satisfy TFT_eSPI while avoiding major changes in the library.

As stated above support for any other MCU families has been stripped however all display drivers should still work.
